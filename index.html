	<h1>PriorityVax</h1>
	
	<p><em>PriorityVax</em> is a user-friendly platform to help document prioritization deliberations about vaccines.</p>
	
	<p>Evidence-to-recommendations frameworks rely on transparent discussions about how evidence is used. <em>PriorityVax</em> is one tool that can help clarify the process.</p>
        
        <p>Considerable efforts have been made to promote National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) and there are lots of resources available to assist with collection and assessment of evidence - although these often remain significant challenges. There are fewer resources, however, to help with prioritization. </p>
        
        <p>Prioritization might come in in the form of comparing a new vaccine to the status quo, prioritizing the order of introducing new vaccines or selecting between products. In all these cases evidence has to be competed to determine some rank ordering of the choices. This is where <em>PriorityVax</em> can help.</p>
        
        <p>Through a user-friendly web interface, <em>PriorityVax</em> takes you through the process of selecting Attributes (decision criteria), weighing the relative importance of these attributes, inputting evidence, assessing the sensitivity of preferences and evidence to uncertainty and producing a shareable report.</p>
